# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This was my grad project for my BE CS. Have implemented a dynamic traffic signal using ultrasonic sensors and arduino. The system senses the traffic density and adjusts the traffic light intervals to provide efficient flow of traffic with less waiting times.

### How do I get set up? ###

Get a arduino MEGA 2560, 12 ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, and servo motors if you want to set up the system with spikes as well.

The pin config is stated into the code and can be referred for cennection.

* How to run tests
If you go through the library there are certain test modules designed to test finctioning of all the connected devices. 
* Deployment instructions
To depoly connect the Arduino to Mac/PC and upload the code using the Arduino IDE, available on Arduino site for free.
